# AI Toolkit Requirements
# Note: Install PyTorch packages separately first (see installation instructions)
# torch, torchvision, and torchaudio are not included here as they need to be
# installed with specific CUDA versions
#
# This file includes ALL dependencies needed to run the toolkit, including:
# - Git dependencies: diffusers (specific commit) and easy_dwpose
# - All Python packages with their required versions
# - PyTorch will be installed as a dependency of easy_dwpose, but installing
#   it separately first ensures proper CUDA support

# Install them BEFORE installing this requirements.txt file:
# pip install --no-cache-dir torch==2.7.0 torchvision==0.22.0 torchaudio==2.7.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
# 
# Note: torchaudio is required by toolkit/config_modules.py and will cause import errors if missing
